# The 5.5-Hour Hackathon Battle Plan

If you want to finish with a playable game, stick to this timeline ruthlessly.

## Hour 0.0 – 0.5: Setup & Alignment
- **Person 1** runs the Initialization Prompt, pushes the repo to GitHub.
- Everyone pulls the repo and runs `npm install` in the `/server` folder.
- Verify everyone can run `node server.js` and see a blank `index.html` on `localhost`.

## Hour 0.5 – 2.0: The Parallel Sprint (Isolated)
- **Person 1**: Builds the Socket.io relay.
- **Person 2**: Builds the Phaser arena, movement, and click-to-cast spells.
- **Person 3**: Builds the audio recorder and proves the Gemini API returns the correct JSON.

> **Rule:** Do not look at each other's code. Just get your piece working locally.

## Hour 2.0 – 3.0: Integration Part 1 (The Cyborg Wizard)
- **Person 3** gives `audio.js` to **Person 2**.
- **Person 2** integrates it: Instead of clicking to cast, holding `SHIFT` slows the player down, records audio, gets the JSON from Gemini, and then fires the spell in Phaser based on the JSON result.

> **Goal:** You have a single-player game where you can yell *"Fireball!"* and it shoots.

## Hour 3.0 – 4.0: Integration Part 2 (Multiplayer Mayhem)
- **Person 2** hands the complete `/client` folder to **Person 1**.
- **Person 1** wires the Phaser events to the Socket.io events.
- When **Player 1** casts a spell locally, emit `SPELL_CAST` to the server. The server broadcasts it, and **Player 2**'s Phaser engine renders the incoming spell.

> **Goal:** Two browser windows open, moving independently, casting spells at each other.

## Hour 4.0 – 5.0: Anomalies, Pickups, & Polish
- Now that the core loop works, split up again.
- One person adds the **Map Pickups** (Blood Vial, Demon Orb).
- One person adds the **Global Anomalies** (Meteor Shower, Targeted Silence).
- One person adds the **"Fel Magic" backfire logic** (if `backfire: true`, explode on the caster).

## Hour 5.0 – 5.5: Code Freeze & Bug Squashing
- **Stop adding features.**
- Play the game. Fix the game-breaking bugs using the `05-systematic-debugging` skill.
- Hardcode some values if you have to. If the volume scaling is acting weird, scrap it and make all spells `1.0x` scale.

> **Rule of thumb:** An MVP that works perfectly is better than a complex game that crashes.
